This directory contains a simple, Java network client library for the
FlightGear flight simulator.  See the JavaDoc documentation for
org.flightgear.fgfsclient.FGFSConnection for more information.

There is a simple demo application, FGFSDemo, that you can try like this:

  fgfs --telnet=9000
  java FGFSDemo localhost 9000

To rebuild the program, use the Apache ant utility.
