This directory contains the files which, along with
the source code tar files, can be used to build
an RPM package targeted at a Red Hat Linux system.

To build flighgear from source do the following:

0.	be root on your system (actually it's possible to
	build from source as a non-root user but
	I won't go into that now).

1.	copy flightgear.spec to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/

2.	copy flightgear.desktop to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES

3.	obtain FlightGear-data-2.8.0.tar.bz2 and flightgear-2.8.0.tar.bz2
	and copy them into /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES.

4.	obtain and install SimGear (= 2.8.0).

5.	look in the BuildRequires section of flightgear.spec
	and check that all the packages referred to are
	installed.

6.	cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
	rpmbuild -ba flightgear.spec

that's it.
