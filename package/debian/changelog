flightgear (0.7.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Forgot to update the version of that simgear build-dep
    again, needs 0.0.18. Closes: #146788.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon, 13 May 2002 05:32:34 +0200

  * Rebuilt with metakit 2.4.3.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed, 27 Mar 2002 21:50:15 +0100

flightgear (0.7.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made debian/rules try hard to get this compiled; if compiling
    with optimization fails, then it'll try again without.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Thu,  7 Mar 2002 13:46:58 +0100

flightgear (0.7.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Yes, I'm subscribed to flightgear-announce, so I knew about 0.7.9
    already, but packaging new releases of this stuff takes some time.
    Closes: #134302.
  * Playing the intro music doesn't seem to hang fgfs in this release,
    and it's no longer played by default anyway. Closes: #104168.
  * Man pages seem to be available now. Closes: #87556, #87557, #87560, #87561.
  * Some binaries without manpages are no longer installed.
    (This includes runfgfs.) Closes: #87558, #87559, #87562.

flightgear (0.7.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Build-depend on plib >= 1.4.1.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 14 Jul 2001 21:55:05 +0200

flightgear (0.7.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Grr... if the plib maintainer keeps insisting on keeping
    an "=" dependency on stable releases so I have to keep rebuilding
    this stuff all the time, I'll soon be in the mood to hijack plib.
    Well, this rebuild closes: #102769.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Tue,  3 Jul 2001 03:41:31 +0200

flightgear (0.7.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * I realized I ought to do a versioned simgear-dev build-dep a few
    hours after the last upload, but this stuff takes a while to
    rebuild and I thought the autobuilders might be able to get it
    right this one time anyway, but they don't, it seems, so I
    guess I have to. It build-depends on simgear-dev >= 0.0.15,
    and plib-dev >= 1.4.0 while I'm at it. Closes: #102364.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Tue, 26 Jun 2001 19:56:30 +0200

flightgear (0.7.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * This release has support for multithreaded tile loading.
    Since Debian can do multithreading, I added --with-threads
    to the configure command.
  * Build-depend on autotools-dev.
    Update config.guess and config.sub from it.
  * Build-depend on debhelper v3.
  * Standards-Version updated to 3.5.5.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Fri, 22 Jun 2001 17:27:20 +0200

flightgear (0.7.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * I can't believe I put the wrong bug number in my previos
    changelog entry (I managed to try to close one of my
    already-closed bugs)... Oh well, for the "install binaries
    into /usr/games" change, I meant: Closes: #90569. So there!

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon,  2 Apr 2001 02:18:47 +0200

flightgear (0.7.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install binaries into /usr/games. Closes: #87269.
  * Data directory moved from /usr/share/FlightGear to
    /usr/share/games/FlightGear.
    Depends on fgfs-base (>= 0.7.6-4) to do this move.
  * Handle DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. Upgrade Standars-Version to 3.5.2.
    (it's a cleaner way to "build without -g on sparc" anyway)

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Thu, 29 Mar 2001 21:26:36 +0200

flightgear (0.7.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build without -g, to work around a g++ bug on sparc.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 18 Mar 2001 17:12:08 +0100

flightgear (0.7.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The plib maintainer keeps on making the lives of
    plib users miserable with his shlibs file. Despite being
    completely equivalent with the previous build, the new plib
    package still has incompatible shlibs, forcing me to recompile.
    Closes: #87269.
  * Added --with-network-olk (networking support) to configure options
    since I had to recompile anyway, so not completely for naught.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat,  3 Mar 2001 19:23:00 +0100

flightgear (0.7.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * For some reason the plib maintainer use shlibs depending
    on the exact debian revision, so everything using plib has
    to be rebuilt whenever he uploads a bugfix or something.
  * Well, now built with debhelper v3, at least.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed, 21 Feb 2001 15:58:38 +0100

flightgear (0.7.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. Closes: #85060.
  * Patched for FHS conformance.
  * Added missing libs to a few link command lines.
