This directory contains code for the FlightGear user interface.
Currently, the code is based on PUI, which is part of PLIB.

The code is currently in transition between the old, hard-coded C++
interface and a new, XML-configurable modular subsystem.

Files:

dialog.[ch]xx           XML-configurable dialog box.
gui.cxx, gui.h          Top-level GUI functions (deprecated).
gui_funcs.cxx           Implementation of internal GUI functions (deprecated).
menubar.[ch]xx          XML-configurable menu bar.
new_gui.[ch]xx          Top-level for the GUI subsystem.
