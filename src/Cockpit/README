src/Cockpit/ - instrument and display-related code

This directory contains various subsystems and code modules related to
the cockpit, including the HUD and the 2D panel.  The code from here
is gradually being sorted out into separate code modules -- please do
not add anything new here.  All new code for gauges and avionics
should go in src/Instrumentation/, and all new code aircraft systems
(like the electrical or vacuum systems) should go in src/Systems/.
Any new 2D or 3D modelling code should go in src/Model/.
